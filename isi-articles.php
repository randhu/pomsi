It was a season that will go down in history as the year in which almost every 1st National Ace Pigeon was a Verkerk descendant, even though only a limited number of Verkerk pigeons stay in their home country. Like we said, all winners in the national competition WHZB/TBOTB has Verkerk origins, except for one (marathon). And Gerard and Bas Verkerk are clearly very proud of that. 2020 has been a fantastic season for them as well, but more on that later.

<h3>NL19-7007134, Jozef of the Eijerkamp family</h3>

<p>This excellent racing bird was 1st National ace pigeon one day long distance WHZB/TBOTB 2000, 1st National ace pigeon middle distance Allerbeste/NPOrgaan and 1st National ace pigeon one day long distance PIPA. The sire (Solange Jr.) of Jozef is a super class breeder for the Eijerkamp family, since Solange Jr. is the sire of several other successful racing birds in Brummen, besides Jozef. Solange Jr. was bred from NL10-1682373/Tyson x NL07-1817923/Olympic Solange. And that same pair also bred Son Solange of the Derksen-vd Keuken combination, which has bred many successful pigeons for this combination.<br />
The Eijerkamp family also won a title of 15th National ace pigeon Allround with Annemie. This pigeon stems from Catherine, a daughter of NL11-1741053/Ferrari (zoon Olympic Solange) x NL10-1682216/Olivia. Annemie won for instance a 6th NPO Chateaudun (4,058 p. and a 10th NPO Chateauroux (3,794 p.). Aberdeen was 21st National ace pigeon Allround, and Aberdeen was bred from Panamera, which is a son of NL13-1239600/Topper Harley x NL15-1706407/Princess. Aberdeen won a 4th National S3 Fay aux Loges (14,036 p.). It was in part with the help of these and other Verkerk pigeons that they became 1st and 2nd best fancier WHZB/TBOTB 2020.</p>

<p>This talented newcomer claimed one or more 1st championship titles across all competitions. The pedigree of this great racing bird includes a half brother and half sister of Olympic SpongeBob, as well as a daughter of Bulldozer. We also spotted a half sister of NL07-1817923/Olympic Solange. This half sister Solange is a full sister of NL10-1682199/New Sensation (the sire of NL12-1619001/Olympic Sofie). That half sister Solange (NL11-1737012) was obtained in a PIPA auction and she is a granddaughter of 2 Olympiad pigeons, namely NL00-1975952/Olympic Survivor x NL00-5063949/Amore (Koopman). This 012 is in turn the dam of an Olympiad Pigeon in 2017, Error 404, a grandmother of Olympiad Pigeon Olympic Janneke (best yearling worldwide in 2019), and now the great-grandmother of China-001. If there had been an Olympiad this year, China-001 would have definitely been there. It is in part thanks to China-001 (a 43.75% Verkerk) and other pigeons with Verkerk origins that the Lin family became 1st National loft champion middle distance nominated 2020.</p>

<p>Besides the ace pigeon titles that we already mentioned, China-001 also won:</p>

<p>This younger pigeon stood out from the start for this father-son combination from Woerden, winning a title of 1st National ace pigeon YBs WHZB/TBOTB 2020. The dam of this pigeon, NL19-3951681/grandchild Eye Catcher, was obtained in the Golden Classic auction (a special breeder-racer ring race). The breeders of this pigeon are Gerard and Bas Verkerk. The sire of NL19-681 is a son of NL15-1706301/Equal First x NL11-1741071/Eye Catcher, and the dam comes from Andter (Van Andel-Terluin) x NL 13)-1239557/Gret (sister Olympic Solange and Eye Catcher).</p>

<p>This great racing bird showed her potential at a young age, winning a 2nd of 1,152 p. and 7th of 1,482 p. And she did even better this year. She was beaten by China-001 in the National ace pigeon championship yearlings &amp; Allround in the Allerbeste-NPOrgaan competition but she still became 2nd National ace pigeon twice, which is also worth a mention. The sire of this top class hen is a son of NL13-1239600/Topper Harley (a half brother of Solange Jr. and Son Solange) x NL11-1740972/Lieke (grandmother of New Olympic Solange).</p>

<h3>Klaas and Jacob de Jong</h3>

<p>Klaas and Jacob obtained some youngsters from their racing birds in 2018, and they had not expected to get a few youngsters of NL16-1526026/New Olympic Solange en NL16-1526131/Davina as well. They also have a youngster of NL12-1618921/Olympic Bibi and a grandchild of NL14-1059627/Olympic Fire Eyes in their breeding loft. It was with the help of these pigeons that this team was impossible to beat in the one day long distance in 2020. They were 1st loft one day long distance in the whole of The Netherlands both in the national championships NPO and in the overall ranking of the Fondspiegel competition.</p>

<p>The national ace pigeons of Derksen-vd Keuken and Doldersum &amp; son are related to NL09-1186402/Goofy, NL10-1682306/Feline, NL16-1526224/Recovery and NL14-1059451/Top Girl.</p>

<p>And they also won several other races and top ten spots NPO with Verkerk descendants. For instance, they claimed a 1st National Gueret in Belgium and a 1st NPO Fay aux Loges, which we will talk about in closer detail.</p>

<h3>1st National Belgium Gueret 12,888 p., Bosman-Leekens</h3>

<p>The dam of this national winner, Triple Bas (what's in a name!) is a daughter of NL14-1059627/Olympic Fire Eyes (son Donald x Eye Catcher) x NL12-1619131/Isa (daughter Bulldozer x Olympic Solange).</p>

<p>The winner, Magic Loya, is a daughter of Tanguy. Tanguy was bred from NL11-1741041/Gavin x NL09-1186437/Bonita. Tanguy is also the sire of Xenon, which was 1st National ace pigeon one day long distance 2018-2019.

<p>Fanciers from the other side of the globe, mainly in China and Taiwan, have been winning races and ace pigeon titles in 2020 with descendants of the pigeon family of Gerard and Bas Verkerk as well. The family of Olympic Solange appears a lot in these pedigrees. Besides, the nest sister of the sire of New Olympic Solange is the dam of a first prize winner in Xian. And a top breeder from NL14-1059447/Rico x NL15-1706407/Princess has bred a champion as well. Breeding pair NL09-1186402/Goofy x NL08-1537203/Cameron Diaz has a solid reputation in China as well, given the achievements of their descendants.</p>

<p>We could say that their key to success was not a specific approach, their lofts or the location of their loft but rather the enormous breeding potential of the Verkerk pigeon. No other pigeon family has such an impressive track record.</p>

<h2><strong>In their own loft...</strong></h2>

<p>Like we discussed in two earlier reports about Vierzon and Fontenay, 2020 has been a great season for Gerard and Bas's own racing team too.</p>

<p>This list could have been a whole lot longer, since Gerard and Bas have an impressive 8 pigeons in the top 25 PIPA Rankings for national ace pigeons yearlings and 7 pigeons in the top 25 national ace pigeons allround. And let's not forget that we are still waiting for the results of the middle distance/one day long distance category.</p>

<h3>A hopeful future</h3>

<p>We are already looking forward to 2021, and Gerard and Bas are trying to get their pigeon family up to speed. They have a terrific racing team and an invaluable group of breeding birds at their disposal, so we are 100% confident that we have plenty of great results to talk about again next year.</p>
